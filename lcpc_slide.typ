  == Motivation

  "Singapore kept its position as the worldâ€™s most expensive city this year, for the ninth time in 11 years." - Economist Intelligence Unit(EIU) Worldwide Cost of Living 2023

  === SG is the most expensive ???

  = Resource Question

  - How to have quick understanding of living cost pressure in a economy?
  - Existing economic indicator doesn't fit well
    - CPI
    - GDP per capita
    - World Cost Of Living  by EIU
  - Let me come out with a suitable one

  == LCPC - Living Cost Pressure Curve

  - Calculate LCP for different group in the economy
    - For example: by income
  - construct a curve to show how living cost pressure distributed in the economy

  = Dive into the data
  - Data from Household Expenditure Survey(HES) by SingStat
    - Conducted every 5 years
    - Each Survey about 14,000 dwellings in Singapore

#uncover(2)[#quote["It is notable, for example, that some resident households in the lowest 20% owned a car (13.6 per cent), employed a maid (13.9 per cent), lived in private property (7.1 per cent) or were headed by persons aged 65 years and over (36.7 per cent) in 2017/18." - HES 2017/18]]

  - Low income may not imply poor
  - Elderly aged 65 years and over should be handled separately

#polylux-slide[
  - All LCP below 1: no household face deficit.
  - LCP of all groups drop from 2007/08 to 2017/18, the lower type of dwelling tends to have higher drop in LCP.
  - LCPC thus become much more "flat" in 2017/18 than in 2012/13, implies social equality has improved.
  - HDB 1-2 Room group has the most improvement from 2012/13 to 2017/18, as a result of larger increment in income than expenditure.
    - This could be a result of large transfer payment by the government.
  - LCPC of 2017/18 is in a slight "W" shape, "middle class squeezed"?

  Should expenditure include \
  Mortgage Repayment?
]

#polylux-slide[
  - Mortgage repayment data is hard to find
    - SingStat has it from HES, but never reveal
  - Mortgage repayment is harder to estimate

  - What's buying a house?
    - Turn cash asset into fixed asset
    - It's investment, not expenditure
  - So, NO
]

#focus-slide[
  Should expenditure include rental?
]

#polylux-slide[
  - YES! It's real expenditure.
  - But, not be relevant to Singaporean
    - About 90% house ownership rate
    - Rental is income for Singaporean

  - Crucial for foreigner in SG
    - 2023: 30% or 1.77M non-residents

  LCPC not just for SG

  Let's look at Hong Kong!

#polylux-slide[
= Conclusion

LCPC has only two simple idea:
- Ratio between expenditure and income: LCP
- LCP for different group, form a curve LCPC

LCPC is simple but versatile.
