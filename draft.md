# Summary

Singapore is an advanced economy sometimes famous for its high GDP per capita and high living cost. These fames are usually news headlines which may be biased[ref TBA]. Existing economic indicators may help public to have a glimpse of Singapore's economic from certain aspects, but they are usually not comprehensive. Public need to digest multiple economic indicators in order to have a better understanding of Singaporean's living cost pressure. In this paper, I propose a new economy indicator: LCMC - Living Cost Misery Curve, which provide holistic view of living cost pressure of a society in a single curve. My focus will be Singapore, but the methodology should be applicable to other economies, cross comparison of LCMC among different economies is also possible.

# Issues of existing economic indicators

## CPI

When considering living cost, Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a commonly used indicator. According to Singapore Statistic Department[ref TBA], the annual CPI using 2019 As Base Year increase from 74 in 2000 to 109 in 2022, but it doesn't imply that Singaporean's economic pressure also increased by 47%. Singaporeans's income level may also increase during the same period. If income level increase at a faster rate than CPI, the actual economic pressure from living cost may drop.
