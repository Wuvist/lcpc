Note(s):,,,,,,,,
(a) The Household Expenditure Survey (HES) is conducted once every 5 years to collect up-to-date information on the expenditure patterns of households in Hong Kong for updating the expenditure weights used for compiling the Consumer Price Index. The 2019/20 HES was conducted during the period from October 2019 to September 2020.,,,,,,,,
(b) Figures or percentages may not add up to the respective totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,
"(c) Group 77 “School fees” covers “Kindergarten”, “Primary”, “Secondary”, “Diploma Yi Jin, craft and technician level”, “Post-secondary (including distance learning)”, “Private, vocational”, “Language courses” and “Other courses”. “Tuition schools and expenses on tuition” is also included.",,,,,,,,
(d) Statistics on medical expenses are subsumed in group 56 “Proprietary medicines and supplies” and group 79 “Medical services”.,,,,,,,,
(e) The classification of commodities/services had been reviewed. Certain groups had been reclassified and/or renamed. The total number of commodity/service groups reduced from 94 in the 2014/15 HES to 88 in the 2019/20 HES.,,,,,,,,
"(f) The data collection of the 2019/20 HES was conducted from October 2019 to September 2020, during which consumer behaviour was severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and household spending on some commodities/services should have deviated significantly from those under normal circumstances. The household expenditure figures of the 2019/20 HES should therefore be carefully interpreted.",,,,,,,,
